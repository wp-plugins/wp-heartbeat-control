Control WP Heartbeat API to speed up website and reduce server CPU Load.

== Description ==

What is WordPress Heartbeat API?

The Heartbeat API, included in the release of WordPress 3.6, provides fluid updates between your browser and the server. This allows for autosaving, post locking, login expiration warnings, and much more. The API works in the background and involves routine communication between the browser and the server that is repeated at regular intervals to ensure they are completely in sync with one another.

However, constantly sending information in such a manner can cause high CPU usage on the server. In fact, even if you were to simply login to your WordPress Dashboard and minimize your browser while you worked on other tasks, the API would still be updating at regular intervals to maintain the features it provides. If you have experienced high CPU loads using the aforementioned WordPress version, you can follow the steps below to disable the WordPress Heartbeat API in different areas of your site.
Who should use this plugin

Although this is the great wordpress feature, but some times the performance of site is more concerned than this feature. You should use this plugin If you are going through HIGH CPU USAGE issues, if your host has sent you an alert/warning about HIGH CPU USAGE, or you can also use this just to improve performance when you have hight traffic website.
